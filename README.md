# Hyperperameter_Tuning_using_GridsearchCV
Used GridsearcCV on Decision Tree Classifier to increase the model accuracy on wine quality dataset
conducted hyperparameter tuning for a Decision Tree classifier. Employing GridSearchCV, I systematically optimized the model's parameters to enhance its accuracy. The project culminated in a data visualization, providing valuable insights into the dataset.
